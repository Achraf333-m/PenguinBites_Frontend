PenguinBites is a personal project intended to be a nutrition app where users are recommended recipes based on ingredients they already have.
It is meant to have a wide range of filters to choose from in order to be as inclusive as possible.
Eventually, I plan on integrating an ML model that learns from the users' preferences and then help recommend the best recipe/meal possible.

Some of my goals are to hone my skills in full-stack development and to learn new technologies as I go on this journey, and eventually if this app reaches the public, my goal would be for to be helpful in a way that is less focused on calorie counting and more on feeling good about oneself while eating while being healthy of course.
